### Step 4

The first step in the lab report was to log into ieng6 server. To achieve this I went to the vscode terminal and typed in `ssh vichandra@ieng6.uscd.edu` inorder to log me into the server.

### Step 5

Because we were able to set up the keys in the lab, the next was simply to copy the ssh link from github. I then went to to the terminal and typed `git clone` followed by `<command v` and `<Enter>`

### Step 6
The next step was to check if the tests in `ListExamplesTests.java`. Inorder to do this, I pressed `cd lab7` and typed `bash test.sh` so that I can see if the tests passed, I was informed that 2 tests were run and 1 failed.

### Step 7

for the seventh step, I typed in `vim ListExamples.java` inorder to view the code and change it. Inorder to change the code, I pressed `esc` followed by `<20 down>`  `<6 right>`. Finally, I pressed `<esc>` again followed by `<i>`, `<backspace` , and typing in `<2>`. After doing this, typed out `<:wq>` which allowed me to save and quit the code. Essentially, this step corrected index1 and changed it to index2.
